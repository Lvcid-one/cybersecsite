README

A website to not only help categorize terms and concepts in the cyber security world but to help me better understand all the information I am learning in my road to work in cyber sec.

This will be an on going project utilizing my notes from many places.

This is in no means a way to replace already far better and more robust sources of information.

This is a learning tool for myself and anyone who may find some value from it.

Even though this is mainly a personal project I will be eventually launching it with a different name/domain in mind. Figure I can use this as a portfolio project in the future. Who knows. I do have a track record of not finishing anything.
