        <h1 id="head">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</h1>
        <p id="explanation">
            (Also known as Email Account Compromise (EAC)) A type of <a href="">phishing</a> attack where a threat actor
            impersonates a known source to obtain financial advantage. It exploits the fact so many of use rely on email
            to conduct business - both personal and professional.
        </p>
        <h1 id="head">How it works:</h1>
        <p id="explanation">
            Threat actors either <a href="">spoof</a> or hack into a CEO's email account, then email employees
            instructions to make a purchase or send money via wire transfer. The threat actor may even ask an employee
            to purchase gift cards, then request photos of the serial numbers.
            <br>
            Some examples include:
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A vendor a company regularly deals with sends an invoice with an updated mailing address.</li>
            <li>A company CEO asks an assistant to purchase dozens of gift cards to send out as employee rewards. She
                asks for the serial numbers so she can email them out right away.</li>
            <li>A homebuyer receives a message for a title company with instructions on how to wire his down payment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        These are only some examples on how a BEC can be carried out that affect both organizations and individuals.
